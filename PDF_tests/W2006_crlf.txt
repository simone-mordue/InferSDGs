Overview
By many measures, global income inequality is high and rising
By many measures, global income inequality is high and rising. In , the average Ethiopian had an income times less than that of someone living in Europe or the united_states of America. Half a century later, Ethiopians have become times poorer. Most of the worlds poorest nations are falling behind in more or less similar degrees. The main reason is that in the industrialized world the income level over the last five decades has grown steadily, while it has failed to do so in many developing countries, especially over the past quarter of a century. Not more than a few developing countries have been growing at sustained rates in recent decades, but these include, most notably, the worlds two most populous countries, China and India. Considering that these two countries alone account for more than one third of world population, inequality across the globe is beginning to decline. When these countries are left out, however, international income inequality is seen as having continued to rise strongly from already high levels (see figure O.).
