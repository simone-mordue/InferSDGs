This small Shiny application demonstrates a text classification model which fits text to the SDGs. It is based on a model developed by Marcelo LaFleur from UNDESA please see https://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2019/wp159_2019.pdf. Please upload .pdf files to see which SDG they most correspond to. Please note at present the model overfits so this in development.
